# Code Explanation: Main.js

Below is a comprehensive explanation of the JavaScript code for the weather app. The code is divided into several sections that handle different functionalities of the app.

## Adding Event Listener to Multiple Elements

The `addEventOnElements` function simplifies adding event listeners to multiple elements. It takes an array of HTML elements, an event type, and a callback function as parameters. Inside a loop, it adds the event listener to each element.

```javascript
// Function to add event listener to multiple elements
const addEventOnElements = function (elements, eventType, callback) {
    for (const element of elements) {
        element.addEventListener(eventType, callback);
    }
};
```

## Toggle Search in Mobile Devices

This section toggles the visibility of a search view on mobile devices. It selects the search view and search toggler elements, then defines a `toggleSearch` function that toggles the "active" class on the search view when a search toggler is clicked.

```javascript
// Selecting elements for toggling search view
const searchView = document.querySelector("[data-search-view]");
const searchTogglers = document.querySelectorAll("[data-search-toggler]");

// Function to toggle search view
const toggleSearch = () => searchView.classList.toggle("active");

// Adding click event listeners to search toggler elements
addEventOnElements(searchTogglers, "click", toggleSearch);
```

## Search Integration

This section handles the search functionality. It listens for changes in the search input field and triggers a search request with a delay. The search results are fetched and displayed as a list of locations.

- `searchField` is the input field for search queries.
- `searchResult` is the element that displays search results.
- `searchTimeout` is used to delay the search request.
- `searchTimeoutDuration` defines the delay duration.

The search input triggers an event listener that manages the search process.

## Main Tag JS

This section handles the main content of the weather app. It selects various elements and defines functions to update and render weather-related data on the page.

- `updateWeather` is a function that fetches weather data and populates the HTML with relevant information, including current weather, highlights, and forecasts.

- The section also handles the rendering of the current location's weather, today's highlights, and a 24-hour forecast.
