# Weather App Router and Functions

## Code Overview

The given code is part of a weather app that interacts with an API to retrieve weather information based on user locations and searched locations. It defines several functions to manage different aspects of the app's functionality. Let's break down the code step by step.

### Imports and Constants

The code starts by importing two functions, `updateWeather` and `error404`, from a module named `main.js`. It also defines a constant `defaultLocation` which specifies a default location as a URL fragment in case the user's current location cannot be determined.

### Getting User's Current Location

The `currentLocation` function uses the `window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` method to obtain the user's current geographic position. If the position is successfully retrieved, the latitude and longitude are extracted from the position's `coords` object, and the `updateWeather` function is called with these coordinates as parameters.

If an error occurs during the geolocation process, the `window.location.hash` is set to the `defaultLocation`, which will redirect the user to the default weather information.

### Retrieving Weather for Searched Location

The `searchedLocation` function takes a query string as input, which is expected to be in the format of key-value pairs separated by "&". It then splits the query string into individual parts, representing the query parameters. The `updateWeather` function is then called with these parameters, effectively triggering an update of the weather information.

### Router Mapping

The code defines a `routers` Map that associates different route paths with corresponding functions. Specifically, the `/current-location` route is mapped to the `currentLocation` function, and the `/weather` route is mapped to the `searchedLocation` function.

### Handling Hash Changes and Page Load

The `checkHash` function is responsible for responding to changes in the window's hash (URL fragment). This function gets the request URL from the hash and splits it into a router and a query part. If the router exists in the `routers` Map, the associated function is called with the query part as an argument. If the router is not found, the `error404` function is called.

The code sets up event listeners for both the `hashchange` event and the `load` event on the `window` object. When the page loads, if no hash is present in the URL, it defaults to `#/current-location`. Otherwise, the `checkHash` function is called to process the current hash.

## Conclusion

In summary, the provided code implements a simple routing mechanism for a weather app. It uses the URL hash to determine which route and associated function should be executed. The app supports retrieving weather information based on the user's current location or a searched location.
