### has-sate Explanation
This CSS code is defining styles for interactive elements with a focus on providing visual feedback during user interactions, such as hovering and focusing. Let's break down the code step by step and provide comments for each part:

```css
.has-state {
  position: relative;
}
```
This snippet sets the CSS class `.has-state` with a `position: relative;` property. This means that any HTML element with the class `.has-state` will serve as a container for absolutely positioned elements inside it.

```css
.has-state:hover {
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-1);
}
```
When an element with the `.has-state` class is hovered over, it will receive a box-shadow effect using a CSS variable `--shadow-1`. This gives the element a shadow when the mouse pointer is over it, indicating interactivity.

```css
.has-state:is(:focus, :focus-visible) {
  box-shadow: none;
}
```
This rule removes the box-shadow when the element is in focus. The `:focus` and `:focus-visible` pseudo-classes are used to target the focused state of the element. This ensures that the box-shadow disappears when the element is focused via keyboard navigation or other methods.

```css
.has-state::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  border-radius: inherit;
  clip-path: circle(100% at 50% 50%);
  transition: var(--transition-short);
}
```
This section creates an absolutely positioned pseudo-element (`::before`) that covers the entire area of the parent `.has-state` element. The `clip-path` property is used to create a circular shape that starts as a fully covered circle (`100%`), positioned at the center of the parent element (`50% 50%`). The `border-radius` is set to `inherit`, meaning it will match the border-radius of the parent element. The `transition` property will apply a smooth transition effect when the properties of this pseudo-element change.

```css
.has-state:hover::before {
  background-color: var(--white-alpha-4);
}
```
When the parent `.has-state` element is hovered over, the circular pseudo-element (`::before`) will gain a background color of `var(--white-alpha-4)`. This creates a visual effect within the circular area of the element.

```css
.has-state:is(:focus, :focus-visible)::before {
  background-color: var(--white-alpha-8);
  animation: ripple 250ms ease forwards;
}
```
For the focused state (either via direct focus or focus-visible), the circular pseudo-element will have a different background color (`var(--white-alpha-8)`) and will also play an animation called `ripple`. The `ripple` animation is defined using a `@keyframes` rule below.

```css
@keyframes ripple {
  0% { clip-path: circle(0% at 50% 50%); }
  100% { clip-path: circle(100% at 50% 50%); }
}
```
The `ripple` animation gradually changes the `clip-path` property of the circular pseudo-element from a fully covered circle (`0%`) to a fully covered circle (`100%`), creating an animated ripple effect expanding from the center of the element. This animation runs for 250ms with an ease timing function and is played forwards, meaning the animation state persists after completion.

Overall, this CSS code creates an interactive and visually appealing effect for elements with the `.has-state` class. It provides visual feedback for hover and focus interactions, utilizing CSS transitions and animations to achieve the desired effects.
